            <h2>The Origins of the QWERTY Layout: A Mechanical Solution to Typewriter Jams</h2>
            <p>The QWERTY keyboard layout was invented by Christopher Latham Sholes in the 1860s to address a mechanical issue with early typewriters. Typebars, the metal arms used to strike ink onto paper, would frequently jam when certain letter combinations were typed too quickly. Sholes designed the layout to spread out commonly paired letters, reducing jams and making typing smoother.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The QWERTY layout was created to prevent typebar jams, not to enhance typing speed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Enduring Legacy of QWERTY: Habit and Typing Efficiency</h2>
            <p>As QWERTY became standard, typists grew accustomed to it. Even when newer typewriters that didn’t jam were introduced, QWERTY remained the dominant layout. Other layouts, like Dvorak, promised efficiency but failed to replace QWERTY because it was too ingrained in people’s habits.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The persistence of QWERTY is due to its widespread use and people’s reluctance to change established habits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Power of Standardization and Network Effects</h2>
            <p>When computers became mainstream, QWERTY’s existing widespread adoption made it the obvious choice for a standardized layout. Changing to a new keyboard layout would have been costly and disruptive. The more people used QWERTY, the more valuable it became, reinforcing its dominance.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> QWERTY became entrenched through standardization and network effects, making it the default across devices and platforms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>QWERTY Today: Still Going Strong</h2>
            <p>Although typewriter jams are no longer an issue, QWERTY remains the default due to its familiarity. New users learn it first, and even modern touchscreen devices like smartphones use the QWERTY layout. While other input methods like voice-to-text and swipe typing exist, the QWERTY layout remains relevant.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> QWERTY’s longevity is a result of its deep-rooted presence in technology and user habits.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            
            <details>
                <summary>1. Why was the QWERTY keyboard layout invented?</summary>
                <p>The QWERTY layout was designed to reduce typebar jams in early typewriters by spacing out commonly used letter combinations.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>2. Why didn’t they use an alphabetical order for the keyboard layout?</summary>
                <p>Alphabetical order would have caused more frequent typebar collisions and jams, which was undesirable for early typewriters.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>3. Are there more efficient keyboard layouts than QWERTY?</summary>
                <p>Yes, layouts like the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard are designed to be more efficient by minimizing finger movement.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>4. Why does QWERTY remain the standard layout today?</summary>
                <p>QWERTY remains standard due to its widespread adoption, the familiarity it provides, and the cost of retraining users for a new layout.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>5. Will we ever switch to a new keyboard layout?</summary>
                <p>While alternatives exist, QWERTY’s entrenched position in global technology makes a switch unlikely in the near future.</p>
