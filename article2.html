            <h2>1. WhatsApp Business API: Paid Features for Businesses</h2>
            <p>The core way WhatsApp makes money is through its Business API, which allows larger companies to connect with customers through WhatsApp. While the basic app remains free, businesses pay to send specific types of messages—like notifications or customer support messages that go beyond a 24-hour response window. This paid API is especially popular with e-commerce, airlines, and financial services, as it allows for efficient, large-scale customer communication.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Indirect Revenue through Meta’s Ad Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>WhatsApp is part of Meta (formerly Facebook), and although it doesn’t show ads directly, it plays a role in Meta’s advertising ecosystem. Businesses can run ads on Facebook and Instagram with a “Click-to-WhatsApp” option, linking users directly to a chat on WhatsApp. While WhatsApp doesn’t earn directly from these ads, the integration helps Meta attract advertisers, indirectly supporting WhatsApp’s business model.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Future Revenue Streams: Payments and E-Commerce</h2>
            <p>In certain countries, WhatsApp has introduced payments, allowing users to transfer money within the app. While currently free, this service has future monetization potential. WhatsApp could charge fees on business transactions or facilitate in-app purchases, opening new income sources as it expands its services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>By focusing on paid services for businesses and leveraging its place within Meta’s broader ad system, WhatsApp sustains its free service while generating revenue. This model has enabled WhatsApp to remain accessible to users while also creating a sustainable business that can continue to grow.</p>
